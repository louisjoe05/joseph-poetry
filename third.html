<h1>ROSES</h1>
<p>Roses, what a beauty in the nature,</br>
   Embellishing the world with wonderful colors.</br>
   Attracting the attention of the admirer,</br>
   and nourishing the hearts of the lovers.
</p>

<p>Open up your ears and listen to my voice, says the gardener</br>
   Roses in the garden are beautiful souls on the earth.</br>
   Listen close to the wisdom of the wise for great is the creator;</br>
   The roses hold a tremendous wealth.
</p>

<p>Sit beside the garden and learn a lesson,</br>
   Notice how the roses struggle for their lives and glory in evry season;</br>
   The bloom is hard but the rose is not selfish,
   A bee talk to another bee:"friend rose bloomed again, we can not perish". 
</p>

<p>Emblem of beauty,grace and happiness are the roses.</br>
   "Respect i don't carry a thorn in vain", says the rose,</br>
   "I live for the sake of others my existence is not vain;</br>
   But wide is my heart, a beautiful soul of beautiful colors i will remain"
